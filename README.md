Java projects (some are from plane java only &amp; some are from different libraries to make some GUIs).
Some projects are for just practice & some are full fledged Programs with different functionalies.
Feel free to contribute & optimise in these projects, I will be really glad.

To run any java file in any machine
we need to create java class file that ends with .class extension
```
javac file_name.java
```
Now once the class is created we can run it
```
java file_name.py
```
